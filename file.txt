In bioinformatics, BLAST for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool is an algorithm for 
comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences 
of different proteins or the nucleotides of DNA sequences. A BLAST search enables a
 researcher to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences, and 
identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.

Different types of BLASTs are available according to the query sequences. For example,
 following the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the mouse, a scientist will
 typically perform a BLAST search of the human genome to see if humans carry a similar
 gene; BLAST will identify sequences in the human genome that resemble the mouse gene
 based on similarity of sequence. The BLAST algorithm and program were designed by
 Stephen Altschul, Warren Gish, Webb Miller, Eugene Myers, and David J. Lipman at the
 National Institutes of Health and was published in the Journal of Molecular Biology
 in 1990 and cited over 50,000 times
