# LASS
Local Alignment Search for Strings, BLAST like string searching algorithm. Final Year Project. B.Tech NIT Silchar

Here, we have developed an algorithm, LASS, which finds all occurrences of one given string within another, in running time 
proportional to the sum of the lengths of the strings. The constant of proportionality is low enough to make this algorithm 
of practical use, and the procedure can also be extended to deal with somemore general pattern-matching problems.
The approach that we applied to draw the guidelines of this algorithmare motivated from BLAST algorithm which is an algorithm 
for comparing primary biological sequence information to taking it to a string searching algorithmwhich is used 
to search and locate a given sequence in a database with great improvement in speed and efficiency of match detection.
